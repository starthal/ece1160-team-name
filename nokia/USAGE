using Nokia LCD found in models 6100, 6610, 7210, 7250, and 5100 with stm32f4-discovery board:

install arm-none-eabi toolchain and libopencm3.  
Easy way to do that is download and install, from github, summon-arm-toolchain;

Driver based on Linch Jim Source Code.
Two Low level function rewrote to implement SPI, using GPIO Port E (pins: 0, 1, 2, 3) of stm32f4-Discovery:

	void WriteSpiCommand(unsigned char data);
	void WriteSpiData(unsigned char data);

Nokia LCD pinout (see png picture Nokia-Pinout.png)

1->	Vcc (3.3V)
2->	#Reset 
3->	Data
4->	Clock
5->	Cs
6->	Vcc (3.3V)
7->	N.C.
8->	Gnd
9->	Vled- (Gnd)
10->	Vled+ (6Volt - 7Volt) 

 


	connection between Nokia-Lcd and discovery-f4
	
	LCD Vcc pins (1, 2) to Discovery 3V power
	LCD Gnd pin (8) to Discovery Gnd
	LCD #Reset pin (2) to Discovery GPIOE 0
	LCD Data pin (3) to Discovery GPIOE 1
	LCD Clock pin (4) to Discovery GPIOE 2
	LCD Cs pin (5) to Discovery GPIOE 3
	LCD Vled- pin (9) to 9V battery minus
	LCD Vled+ pin (10) to 9v battery plus through Potentiometer	


	A potentiometer has 3 pin: 1, 2, 3.

	connect 10K potentiometer:

		pin 1 to +9V and pin 3 to ground
		pin 2 to LCD Vled+ pin (pin 10)
